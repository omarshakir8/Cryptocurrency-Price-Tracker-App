# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Crypto Price Tracker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An IOS app that tracks Crypto prices

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A simple and elegant price tracker app that allows the user to track through a list of cryptocurrencies. The goal is to be able to track over 1000 cryptocurremcies seamlessly. The Cryptocurrencies will have their respective icons being displayed. Prices will be displayed in USD Currency. They will be sorted from the highest priced coins to the lowest. price and logo data will be pulled from API. API will be in JSON Format. JSON file will be decoded to pull in data from and make it readable and parseable. there will be seperate call functions for prices and logo/images. The ability for the app to load in data faster through the use of caching. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A functioning app that displays the prices of atleast 5 cryptocurrencies

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fully functioning app with over a 1000 coins in the lis that the user can browse through and see their respestive icosn and logos. Seamless loading times with the help of caching after data is captured from api. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope to implement a graph or charts function along with everything. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Need to research how to create a mock response from api
need to learn how to decode json file to make it readable for data to be pulled in
