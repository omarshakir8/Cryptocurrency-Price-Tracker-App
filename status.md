Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Obtained API from CoinAPI for crypto prices and data, extracted this data, and made it readable in xcode

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Have to create user interface to navigate list of crypto, add logos to crypto

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
getting xcode to be able to extract the api data and make it readable was difficult, but several tries and multiple attempts made it work. Getting the logos to show up properly was also very time consuming. Currently when opening up the app, when data is captured from api it loads very slowly. The goal is when the data is captured; to cache it so it loads faster.
