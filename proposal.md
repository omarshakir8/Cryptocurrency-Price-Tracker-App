# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Speaker Visualizer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Upload music and play on the speaker while also visualizing it

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Upload music .wav file, run the file through a frequency and use that to plug into an LED to make designs. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Omar Shakir/Ryan Shawareb

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functioning speaker with an LED design

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Detect an instrument and alter the LEDs color and speed

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Detect all of the instruments and have the LED make a design based off it

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to research how to open .wav files and decipher them
We need to figure how to build and assemble hardware the speaker using raspberry pi
